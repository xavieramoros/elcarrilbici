Send WordPress Pages, Posts or Custom Post Types to your Buffer (bufferapp.com) account for scheduled publishing to social networks.

== Description ==

WP to Buffer is a plugin for WordPress that sends updates to your Buffer (bufferapp.com) account  for scheduled publishing to social networks when you publish and/or update WordPress Pages, Posts and/or Custom Post Types.

Plugin settings allow granular control over choosing:
- Sending updates to Buffer for Posts, Pages and/or any Custom Post Types
- Sending updates when any of the above are published, updated or both or neither
- Text format to use when sending an update on publish or update events, with support for tags including site name, Post title, excerpt, categories, date, URL and author
- Which social media accounts connected to your Buffer account to publish updates to (Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn)

When creating or editing a Page, Post or Custom Post Type, sending the update to Buffer can be overridden for that specific content item.
