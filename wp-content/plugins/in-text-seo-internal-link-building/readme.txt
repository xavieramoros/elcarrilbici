Improve your SEO and time on site of your visitors by automatically creating internal links between your posts and pages. 

== Description ==

The Notedlinks WP Plugin is a FREE rule based in-text link manager that allows you to automatically build internal links on your website.

The plugin links keywords and phrases in your posts and comments based on the rules that you have previously defined. With the rules you define the linking keywords to the correspondent urls. 

This is a great solution to:

* Improve user's navigation and experience with internal links
* Increase your overall time on site and pageviews  
* Improve SEO by spreading the link juice around your website
* Add affiliate links to other sites

You can also modify the settings to limit the number of links per post or links with the same keyword. You can also set up the nofollow attribute and open links in a new window.

= BONUS FEATURE =
The plugin also suggests keywords on your posts that should be linked to specific internal posts to improve your SEO. This functionality is currently only working for medium and big sites, but it's free to try for anyone.

It's free and a good alternative to SEO Smart Links plugin with an extra feature of link recommendation.
